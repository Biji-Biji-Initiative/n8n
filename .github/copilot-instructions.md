# n8n — AI Coding Instructions

> **Full project context**: See `AGENTS.md` at the repository root.

## Key Conventions

- **Specs vs Docs**: Specs (`specs/`) define testable contracts (WHAT MUST BE TRUE). Docs (`docs/`) explain what IS and HOW TO USE IT.
- **Normative language**: Use RFC 2119 terms — MUST, SHOULD, MAY — in specs and requirements.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Use stable IDs (`AC-001`, `AC-002`) mapped to verification methods.
- **Verify before commit**: Run the project's test/lint/build pipeline before committing.
- **No version downgrades**: Fix issues at the current version, never downgrade dependencies.
